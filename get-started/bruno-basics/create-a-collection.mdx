title: "Create a Collection"
---

A collection in Bruno is a structured group of API requests, tests, and related resources that helps you organize and manage your API testing workflow.

<Info>
  If you have an existing collection inside of another tool that you would like to import, please see [Importing Collections <strong><sup>↗</sup></strong>](../import-export-data/import-collections).
</Info>

## How to Create a Collection

1. Open Bruno and navigate to the **home screen**
2. Click on the `···` button and select `Create Collection` from dropdown.

5. Click **Create**

Congratulations! You have successfully created your first collection.

<Info>
  Starting with Bruno v3.1.0, YAML (OpenCollection format) is the default file format when creating new collections. Learn more about [OpenCollection YAML](/opencollection-yaml/overview).
</Info>

## Automatic Git Configuration

When you create a new collection or workspace, Bruno automatically generates a `.gitignore` file with recommended settings to ensure proper Git hygiene out of the box.

**What's Included in `.gitignore`:**
- Temporary files and caches
- Environment variable files with sensitive data
- Generated metadata
- System-specific files

<Tip>
  The automatically generated `.gitignore` file helps prevent accidentally committing sensitive information (like API keys in environment variables) or unnecessary files to version control.
</Tip>

## Custom Collection Names

<Info>
  Starting with [Bruno v1.40.0 <strong><sup>↗</sup></strong>](https://www.usebruno.com/downloads), you can
  now use special characters in collection names and customize how they appear in
  the filesystem.
</Info>

You can use any characters in your collection names, including special characters like `/`, `[`, `]`, `*`, etc. Bruno automatically handles filesystem compatibility by replacing unsupported characters with `-` in the filenames while preserving your original collection name.

[Add a request <strong><sup>↗</sup></strong>](https://docs.usebruno.com/bruno-basics/create-a-request) to your collection as a next step!
