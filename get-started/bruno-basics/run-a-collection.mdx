title: "Run a Collection"
---

Running your Bruno Collection allows you to interact with, and test, an API. We allow you to run your Collections a few different ways:

### Collection Runner

We have a built-in Collection Runner that allows for **unlimited** runs.

Run your Collection by either clicking the `...` button next to your Collection in the sidebar then select `Run`

![Click Run](/images/screenshots/get-started/bruno-basics/run_collection/run_collection.webp)

or click the Collection Runner icon in the top bar of the application.

You'll now have access to run the collection, add parameters, or set a delay between requests.

<Warning>
  The Collection Runner does not include gRPC and WebSocket requests. Only HTTP requests will be executed when running a collection.
</Warning>

> _Data-driven testing by using a .CSV file is available in our Pro and Ultimate Edition_

### Automating Runs in CI/CD

Bruno offers a command-line utility to run Collections. This allows you to integrate your tests into a CI and build process.
