VS Code is known as the most popular code editor among developers. It's open source and free to use. VS Code has built-in GitHub Copilot support for AI code completion and you can configure it to use Bruno as your AI agent.

GitHub Copilot is a powerful AI agent that can help you write code faster and more efficiently.

## Configure GitHub Copilot with Bruno

1. Download and install VS Code from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

2. After installing VS Code, install the [GitHub Copilot extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot).

3. Create a `copilot-instructions.md` file inside the `.github` folder at the root of your project.

Your project folder structure should look like this:

<Tree>
  <Tree.Folder name="my-project" defaultOpen>
    <Tree.Folder name=".github" defaultOpen>
      <Tree.File name="copilot-instructions.md" />
    </Tree.Folder>
    <Tree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
      <Tree.Folder name="routes">
        <Tree.File name="users.js" />
        <Tree.File name="auth.js" />
      </Tree.Folder>
      <Tree.File name="app.js" />
      <Tree.File name="server.js" />
    </Tree.Folder>
    <Tree.File name="package.json" />
    <Tree.File name=".gitignore" />
  </Tree.Folder>
</Tree>

<Warning>
  You can write your own instructions for Copilot to follow while working on the collection or you can use the [default instructions provided by Bruno](https://github.com/bruno-collections/ai-assistant-prompts/tree/main/prompts/copilot/.github/copilot-instructions.md).
</Warning>

## Use Cases

Once configured, you can use GitHub Copilot to generate Bruno collections from your API source code, write tests, and automate common API development tasks. The instructions file guides Copilot on how to work with Bruno's collection format and scripting APIs.
