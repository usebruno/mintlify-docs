Claude is a powerful AI agent that can help you write code faster and more efficiently. It empowers developers, testers, and non-technical users to write code and automate their workflows.

## Configure Claude with Bruno

1. Download and install Claude from [here](https://claude.ai/download).

2. After installing Claude, open your project and create a `.claude/CLAUDE.md` file at the root of your project.

Your project folder structure should look like this:

<Tree>
  <Tree.Folder name="my-project" defaultOpen>
    <Tree.Folder name=".claude" defaultOpen>
      <Tree.File name="CLAUDE.md" />
    </Tree.Folder>
    <Tree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
      <Tree.Folder name="routes">
        <Tree.File name="users.js" />
        <Tree.File name="auth.js" />
      </Tree.Folder>
      <Tree.File name="app.js" />
      <Tree.File name="server.js" />
    </Tree.Folder>
    <Tree.File name="package.json" />
    <Tree.File name=".gitignore" />
  </Tree.Folder>
</Tree>

<Warning>
  You can write your own instructions for Claude to follow while working on the collection or you can use the [default instructions provided by Bruno](https://github.com/bruno-collections/ai-assistant-prompts/blob/main/prompts/vscode/.vscode/ai-instructions.md).
</Warning>

## Use Cases

Once configured, Claude can help you:

- **Generate Bruno collections** - Create API collections from your backend source code with requests, tests, and documentation
- **Write scripts and tests** - Use Claude to write pre-request scripts, test scripts, and assertions
- **Automate workflows** - Get help with CI/CD pipelines, environment setup, and collection organization

For the best results, reference Bruno's [JavaScript API Reference](/testing/script/javascript-reference) and [Bru Lang](/bru-lang/overview) documentation in your Claude instructions so it can generate valid Bruno collection files and scripts.
